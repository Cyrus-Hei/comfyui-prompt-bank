### Why?
Saving prompts within images while is quite visual, it is not that simple to manage and navigate when you got tons of images. Added that it requires a bunch of clicks to retrieve your prompts when your workflow is slightly more than basic. I have always wanted an easy and quick prompt manager where one can store prompts and also group them by character or something. So this is pretty much what I envisioned, have at it!
